        Nobody’s born smart. We all start at 0. <strong>Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra</strong>.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are <em>born</em> to learn.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You <em>stumble</em>, <em>slip</em>, <em>crawl</em>, <em>fall</em> and <em>fail</em> and <em>fall</em>.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        <strong>Failing is just another word for growing.</strong> And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. learning.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are <strong> on basic ideas that <em>anyone</em>, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever <em>you</em> are, wherever you are.</strong><br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn anything.
